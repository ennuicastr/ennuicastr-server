/* Here's how client login works: The client opens this page, and it then opens
 * the browser, and is redirected to login-client.jss . The browser opens this
 * page, which opens the standard login page (if applicable) in an iframe.
 * /panel/ checks if it's part of the client login, and if it is, forwards to
 * otk/ . otk/ generates a one-time key, which the user then pastes into
 * login-client.jss in the client. The one-time key login is through
 * /panel/login/otk/ */
