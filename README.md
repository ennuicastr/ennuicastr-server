This is the server component for Ennuicastr, a system for recording multiple
users distributed across the world in a well-synchronized way, without
significant loss, over the web. This is the server software that runs
https://ecastr.com/ , the main installation of Ennuicastr.

This software is divided into several subcomponents:

db:     The database

njsp:   The configuration for NodeJS-Server-Pages
        (`npm install nodejs-server-pages`), which is needed to run the
        templated web site component.

server: The server for Ennuicastr recordings itself.

web:    The web page

cook:   Tools used to process raw audio into usable formats.


Some very light documentation on running your own instance of Ennuicastr is
provided in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).


# Server requirements

The server has two main components: The Ennuicastr protocol server, and the web
components. The web components use
[nodejs-server-pages](https://github.com/Yahweasel/nodejs-server-pages), so
you'll need to set up your web server of choice to use that.

For nodejs-server-pages WebSockets to work, your web server needs to delegate
/ws accesses to it. In nginx, for example:
```
        location ~ /ws$ {
                proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/nodejs-server-pages-ws.sock;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_read_timeout 86400;
                proxy_send_timeout 86400;
                send_timeout 86400;
        }
```

For the AudioWorkletProcessor to be able to use SharedArrayBuffer, you need the
correct "security" features. For instance, in nginx:
```
        add_header 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy' 'same-origin';
        add_header 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy' 'require-corp';
```

The client uses Jitsi to communicate, so you'll need to set up a Jitsi server.
If the client is at https://weca.st/ , then Jitsi must be at
https://jitsi.weca.st/ . That is, it must be at jitsi.X, where X is the domain
used for the client.

You can hide the actual Jitsi interface, since Ennuicastr provides its own. In
nginx, for example:
```
    location = / {
        return 301 https://ecastr.com/;
    }

...

    location @root_path {
        #rewrite ^/(.*)$ / break;
        return 301 https://ecastr.com/;
    }
```

Jitsi will also need correct CORS so that it can be connected to from another
domain. For instance, with nginx and weca.st:
```
    location = /http-bind {
...
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://weca.st';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range';
    }
```
