ISC.

The actual text of the license is in the header of each file. License text is
kept there instead of here because it's very easy for a LICENSE file to become
out of sync with the actual licensed code (in fact, almost inevitable). It is
poor practice to keep license information for code in a separate file from the
code it licenses.

This LICENSE file is here because some people are comforted by its presence.
